Repository where I'll place my answers to the exercises outlines in the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) book.

The strategy I'm planning to follow:

- Watch a video on the [UC Berkeley CS 61A](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9) playlist.
- Go through the sections of the book covered by the lesson and do the exercises.
- Repeat.

I'll use [CHICKEN](https://call-cc.org/) Scheme compiler and interpreter.
