; Newtonâ€™s method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an
; approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by
; the value
; 
; ((x/y^2) + 2y) / 3
; 
; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the 
; square-root procedure.

(define (cube x) (* x x x))
