; A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was published in
; 1770 by the German mathematician J.H. Lambert:
; 
; tan x = x / (1 - x^2 / (3 - x^2 / (5 - ...)))
; 
; where x is in radians. Define a procedure (tan-cf x k) that computes an
; approximation to the tangent function based on Lambertâ€™s formula. k specifies
; the number of terms to compute, as in Exercise 1.37.

             (lambda (i) (- (* 2 i) 1))
             k))
