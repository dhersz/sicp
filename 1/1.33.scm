; You can obtain an even more general version of accumulate (Exercise 1.32) by
; introducing the notion of a filter on the terms to be combined. That is,
; combine only those terms derived from values in the range that satisfy a
; specified condition. The resulting filtered-accumulate abstraction takes the 
; same arguments as accumulate, together with an additional predicate of one
; argument that specifies the filter. Write filtered-accumulate as a procedure. 
; Show how to express the following using filtered- accumulate:
; 
; a. the sum of the squares of the prime numbers in the interval a to b 
; (assuming that you have a prime? predicate already written)
; 
; b. the product of all the positive integers less than n that are relatively 
; prime to n (i.e., all positive integers i < n such that GCD(i, n) = 1).
