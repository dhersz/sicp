; Explain, in general, why equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to
; different answers. Can you devise an interval-arithmetic package that does not
; have this shortcoming, or is this task impossible? (Warning: This problem is
; very difficult.) 

; The answers to exercises 2.14 and 2.15 already answer the first part of the
; question.
;
; Not sure if such package is impossible or not, but it's certainly very
; difficult, because you'd need some very clever algorithms to reduce the
; expression to their "lowest terms" (for lack of a better term). Not even gonna
; bother trying to develop such package.
