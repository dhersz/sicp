; Suppose we evaluate the expression (list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4))). Give the
; result printed by the interpreter, the corresponding box-and-pointer
; structure, and the interpretation of this as a tree (as in Figure 2.6).

; Printed by the interpreter:
; (1 (2 (3 4)))
;
; Not gonna bother trying to draw diagrams and trees here. I drew them on a
; notebook.
